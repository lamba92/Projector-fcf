# Projector | Firebase Cloud Functions

This project have been built for the exam of Programmazione per dispositivi mobili at the University of Turin.
Those functions are part of the backend for the app [Projector](https://github.com/lamba92/Projector).

## Getting Started

Clone the repo on your machine. After that you will need to create a new project on Firebase [here](https://firebase.google.com/), then follow the instructions to setup `firebase-tools`. Keep in mind you-ll need [`NodeJs`](https://nodejs.org/it/download/).

[Here's the essay of the app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lamba92/Projector/master/stuff/relazione.pdf).
